## Getting Started 

 

PathFinder Pro is a desktop application that serves as an operational research tool. 

This applicationâ€™s main purpose is to calculate the shortest path between summits defined by the user by selecting one of the three algorithms available : Bellman Ford, Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall. 

PathFinder Pro provides a user-friendly interface implementing a drag and drop method to position and move the items freely and intuitively. 

Use your mouse to place the summits and vertices on the board. Then you can type the summits name and weight and select an algorithm. 

Keep in mind that for each algorithm, some conditions will have to be validated in order to procede with the calculations. 

 

 

## Details on PathFinder Pro project 

 
PathFinder Pro was developped using Java, a widespread programming language, thus allowing students to easily study the program and try out different things for educational purposes.
